                <li>Tennis: My weekly activity with friends if it's anything sport-related.</li>

                <li>Cycling: Besides from the fact that I commute to school and work with my bike, cycling is also how I try to calm myself down.</li>
                <li>Kung-Fu: My other weekly activity. Also the main way I try to keep myself fit.</li>
                <li>Airsoft: Sadly enough this hobby of mine is very expensive. </li>

            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>Gaming has always been big part in my life. My main interest of game genres is RTS or Real-Time Strategy. I used to play Starcraft II and Teamfight Tactics professionally. I'll give a quick summary on both games.</p>
            <p>Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is a spinoff of League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. The game released as a League of Legends game mode for Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.</p>
            <p>StarCraft II is a military science fiction video game created by Blizzard Entertainment as a sequel to the successful StarCraft video game released in 1998. Set in a fictional future, the game centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among the various fictional races of StarCraft. StarCraft II single-player campaign is split into three installments, each of which focuses on one of the three races: StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (released in 2010), Heart of the Swarm (2013) and Legacy of the Void (2015). A final campaign pack called StarCraft II: Nova Covert Ops was released in 2016.</p>
            <p>Professional StarCraft II competition features professional gamers competing in Blizzard Entertainment's real-time strategy game StarCraft II. Professional play began following the game's initial release in 2010, as the game was the sequel to StarCraft, considered one of the first esports and the foundation of South Korea's interest and success in competitive gaming. Between 2016 and 2019, competition was centered around the Global StarCraft II League in Korea and the World Championship Series Circuit everywhere else, with all Blizzard-sanctioned events being under the StarCraft II World Championship Series (WCS) banner. Since 2020, Blizzard changed the format of WCS by entering into a three-year partnership with esports organizers ESL and DreamHack.</p>
            <p>The first video will show you how StarCraft II works on a competitive level and since I can't find a video regarding this in Teamfight Tactics, gameplay on the highest level will do.</p>
