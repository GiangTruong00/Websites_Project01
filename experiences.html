        <h1>Experiences</h1>
        <h2>Work Experiences</h2>
        <p>As a student I've done a few small jobs:</p>
        <p><strong>2017 - 2020:</strong>
            Hubo Centrale - Wommelgem</p>
        <p>Assisted as an administrative accounting employee, warehouse worker, in advertising, and in insurance during several school holidays over the years. Learned to work with SAP. I've gained a lot of experience here from multiple different branches and learned to work with clients.</p>
        <p><strong>2022 - now:</strong>
            Tuincenter Pelckmans - Turnhout</p>
        <p>Worked as cashier, gardener and maintained their webshop. I haven't done too much here yet since I haven't worked a lot of days yet since I'm studying as well.</p>
        <h2>Out-of-work Experiences</h2>
        <p>ROM hacking is the process of modifying a ROM image or ROM file of a video game to alter the game's graphics, dialogue, levels, gameplay, and/or other elements. This is usually done by technically inclined video game fans to improve an old game of importance, as a creative outlet, or to make new, unofficial games using the old game's engine. ROM hacks either re-design a game for new, fun gameplay while keeping most if not all the items the same, or unlock/reimplement features that exist in the game's code but are not utilized in-game.</p>
        <p>I have been an <strong>Assistant Mapper</strong> in several Pokemon games.</p>
